This is how I make the state voter file small enough to work with in google
docs.
First I download the voter file from
https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/election-results-and-data/2014-elections-results/

I then open it in excel and save the "master" tab as a csv file 

I am also exploring using: https://www.zamzar.com/convert/xlsx-to-csv/

I add line feeds to that file with tr '\r' '\n' <  2016Precinct.csv >2016PrecinctLF.csv

I then figure out how many lines form the header with:
head -178 2016PrecinctLF.csv | tail -33 

I copy those header lines into the output file: 
 head -176 2016PrecinctLF.csv >2016OH7counties.csv

I limit the file to just the counties that Harbaugh has a piece of:
egrep -E "Ashland|Coshocton|Holmes|Huron|Knox|Knox|Lorain|Medina|Richland|Stark|Tuscarawas" 2016PrecinctLF.csv >> 2016OH7counties.csv

I then sort the sheet by the number of Gibbs voters and eliminate precincts
that have no Gibss voters. 

I then add a header row in which I compute the total number of votes in that column and eliminate the columns for races that receive no votes.
